# Graph Assignment

This project focuses on graph representations using the Adjacency List Graph (ALGraph) abstract data type (ADT) and the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Overview

The ALGraph is implemented using `std::vec` to optimize the maintenance of order in the adjacency lists. The project includes a class definition in `ALGraph.h` and an implementation in `ALGraph.cpp`. The `test.cpp` file contains unit tests for the implementation.

## Features

- **Adding Edges:** Directed and undirected edges can be added to the graph using `addDEdge` and `addUEdge`, respectively.
- **Viewing the Graph:** The `dumpGraph` method prints the adjacency lists in a human-readable format. Graphs are also saved in the DOT format for visualization.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** The `dijkstra` method implements Dijkstra's all-source shortest paths algorithm, returning a vector of `DijkstraInfo` with the shortest path information.

## Compilation and Testing

Use the provided Makefile for compilation and testing:

- **Compile the code:**
  ```
  make
  ```
- **Run a specific test:**
  ```
  make test<test_number>
  ```
- **Run a test without comparing to the expected output:**
  ```
  make test<test_number>-nocompare
  ```
- **Clean up compiled files:**
  ```
  make clean
  ```
- **Generate a PNG file for graph visualization:**
  ```
  make test<test_number>-dot
  ```

## Usage

To use the ALGraph in a project, include `ALGraph.h` and link against the compiled `ALGraph.cpp`. Instantiate the `ALGraph` class and use its methods to add edges and perform graph operations.

## Debugging

The `getAdjList` method provides direct access to the internal adjacency list for debugging purposes.

## Visualization

Graphs can be visualized using Graphviz by converting the `.dot` files generated by the `dumpGraph` method.
